# Fetch

This is my final project for the Concordia Bootcamps Web Development Bootcamp. 

The Goal of Fetch: 

Fetch is intended to be a social-networking website dedicated to connecting dog owners and their pets with other owners and dogs in their area, specifically for the purpose of coordinating "play dates". 

The Demo Website: 

Fetch's user base is currently populated only with simulated users and data, to give an idea of how the website looks and feels with other users. 

Features of the Website: 

1. Users have a secure sign-in to the site using Auth0. 

2. The Homepage is populated with displays of all nearby users and their general information. Clicking on one of the displays leads to the specified user's full profile (which includes general information about the user along with all previous status updates made by the user, and their current pending playdate requests with other users). 

3. The Profile Page displays the current logged-in user's information, as well as their previous statuses and current pending playdate requests. From their profile, logged-in users have the ability to post new statuses, edit their profile information, and accept or decline their pending playdate requests. 

4. The Play Date Page allows the current logged-in user to request playdates with other nearby users and cancel the requests as well. 

Potential Future Features: 

1. A Private Message Page where logged-in users can select from other users in their area and send them a personalized message. 

2. The ability for logged-in users to add friends. 

3. A comment feature on status updates to allow for users to comment on other users' status updates.
